              <td>RNR 15048, a fine grained blast resistant paddy variety, christened ‘Telangana Sona’, is fast gaining popularity among farmers in Penna ayacut. RNR 15048 has gained ready acceptance because of  its <strong> unique grain size, short slender slender shape, high grain yield potential,high head rice recovery, good cooking quality</strong>  and above all robust blast resistance characteristics.Hyderabad-based professor of Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) has developed the new rice variety to enable the farmers overcome recurring problems associated with delay in monsoon and deficiency in rainfall, besides reaping good harvest with low investment, sources said.Many farmers under Penna ayacut area, especially in Muthukur, Venkatachalam, Vakadu, Rapur, Balayapalli and Naidupeta have raised Telangana Sona (RNR 15048) in over 5,000 acres in the rabi season.

                It is easy to raise ‘Telangana Sona’ in place of BPT due to its suitability for late planting conditions in kharif and potential to reap good yield with low expenditure in both crop season.The cultivation of ‘Telangana Sona’ in 16 acres in rabi season.Cost of raising RNR 15048 in one acre is `20,000 to `24,000 compared to `25,000 to `30,000 for raising BPT variety in one acre". “There is a good demand from traders for the RNR variety of paddy when compared to BPT.The use of pesticides is less when compared to BPT variety of paddy".

                Low Glycemic Index rice fit for diabetics
                
                Its low Glycemic Index of 51.5 percentage compared to the popular Sona Masuri BPT 5204 rice variety (Glycemic index of 56.5) has made it a preferred choice for health conscious consumers, particularly diabetic patients
                
                New paddy variety bursts onto scene
                
                Prompted by the Telangana farmers’ success in cultivation of the new rice variety, more farmers in Nellore district are showing interest to take up cultivation of ‘Telangana Sona’
                It is highly palatable and suits health conscious consumers
