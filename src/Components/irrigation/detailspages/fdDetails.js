    title: "Powdery mildew",
    describe: "Powdery mildew can easily be diagnosed by the white, powdery patches that form on the upper surface of leaves and stem.Greyish white powdery growth appears on the leaf, sheath, stem and floral parts.",
    solution: "Foliar fungicides can be used to control powdery mildew infection, application early in disease development is most effective."

    title: "Loose smut",
    describe: "It is a seed borne disease; infection occurs during Loose Smut flowering through wind-borne spores.At this time, infected heads emerge earlier than normal heads. The entire inflorescence is commonly affected and appears as a mass of olive-black spores, initially covered by a thin gray membrane.Once the membrane ruptures, the head appears powdery.",
    solution: "Use clean seed: Apply systemic fungicide treatment of seeds. Contact fungicides are not effective.Perform field checks for infected seed and prevent the use of seeds from infected fields for further cropping."

    title: "Brown rust",
    describe: "The most common site for symptoms is on upper leaf blades, however, sheaths, glumes and awns may occasionally become infected and exhibit symptoms.The pustules are circular or slightly elliptical, smaller than those of stem rust, usually do not coalesce, and contain masses of orange to orange-brown Urediospores.",
    solution: "Triazole fungicides have been used to control the brown rust disease. The killing of the alternate host of P . triticina is usable in preventing the infection."

    title: "Damping Off",
    describe: "Damping off of tomato occurs in two stages, i.e. the pre-emergence and the post-emergence phase.In the pre-emergence the phase the seedlings are killed just before they reach the soil surface.The young radical and the plumule are killed and there is complete rotting of the seedlings.",
    solution: "Treatment for Damping Off. There is no cure for plants that already have damping off. However, you can easily prevent the problem by providing good air circulation."

    title: "Septoria leaf spot",
    describe: "Less vigorous plant are usually affected.Small, round to irregular spots with a grey center and dark margin on leaves.Spots usually start on lower leaves and gradually advance upwards.",
    solution: "Water the soil not the leaves.Spraying with a copper fungicide will give fairly good control of the bacterial disease."

    key: 3,
    title: "Bacterial stem and fruit canker",
    describe: "Disease appears as spots on leaves, stems and fruits and as wilting of leaves and shoots.White blister like spots in the margins of leaves.Spots become brown with age and coalesce, but leaves do not fall off.",
    solution: "The best way to treat tomato stem canker is to remove and dispose of the entire plant immediately. Don't add it to your compost as the fungus can survive for a year in soil and affected plant debris."

    title: "Bacterial leaf streak Xanthomonas oryzae",
    describe: "Small, water-soaked streaks between leaf veins which are initially dark green and then turn translucent; streaks grow larger, coalesce and turn light brown in color; tiny beads of yellow colored bacterial exudate are common on the surface of the streaks; leaves turn brown and then gray-white in color before they die.",
    solution: "Control of bacterial leaf streak is dependent on the use of resistant rice varieties and on planting of treated seed"
  },
  {
    key: 2,
    title: "Bakanae Fusarium moniliforme",
    describe: "Seedlings are elongated, slender and pale; seedlings are stunted and chlorotic; death of seedlings; abnormal elongation of older plants which often makes them visible as they grow taller than uninfected plants in the field; sterile plants which do not produce panicles or produce empty panicles.Disease transmitted through infected seed; disease emergence favored by high temperatures.",
    solution: "Treating seeds with appropriate fungicides prior to planting can be very effective at controlling the disease; less susceptible rice varieties should be grown in areas where fungicide-treated seed is not available."

    key: 3,
    title: "Tungro Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV)",
    describe: "Plants are stunted with a yellow-orange discoloration; plants may have a reduced number of tillers and rust colored spots on leaves; leaves may be mottled, striped or exhibit interveinal necrosis.Disease is the most severely damaging virus of rice in South and Southeast Asia; virus is transmitted by leafhoppers.",
    solution: "Rice varieties resistant to tungro virus have been developed and control the disease successfully; intense cultivation has led to the breakdown of the resistance by some virulent leafhopper strains; in Indonesia, the disease is successfully controlled by scheduling planting to obtain synchronous development and practicing crop rotation with resistant varieties."
